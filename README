EXAMPLE OF USE OF CODEMIRROR [1] JS LIBRARY

This project is an example of how to use codemirror library as an online editor for your own html page. Be aware that editing pure HTML is a *very* dangerous option (XSS specially),
so you should try this only on your own server, not giving access to a non trust user, YOU'RE WARNED!

REQUIREMENTS

  * HTTP server with PHP support (using it as a backend language, but you could use any of your taste)
  * WebBrowser with JAVASCRIPT enabled

HOW TO USE IT

You sould grab a copy of the project, by cloning it to your HTTP server (you're going to need PHP interpreter). Then:

  1) Point your webbrowser to index.php page
  2) Login by clicking the top right link (root/toor)
  3) Edit the HTML code and save it
  4) Logout of the edit mode and you'll see your changes
